# T2-empty-acme

This topology creates all the virtual devices, all the interfaces and related addressing.

It configures BGP on **all the devices except ACME's**.

It will allow you to configure on your own OSPF, BGP and related policies on the ACME devices (login to any other device to check the routes, or use `netlab validate`).
