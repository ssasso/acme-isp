# T1-core-only

This topology creates all the virtual devices, all the interfaces and related addressing.

It configures OSPF and BGP on both Core Routers and *CORP-1*/*CORP-2*.

It will allow you to configure BGP and related policies on **Customer-1 router** (login to *core1* to check the routes, or use `netlab validate`).
