# address pools
## let's define here the main address pools that will be used on the links
## some pools will contain only one subnet, some others will contain multiple subnets
##  that will be dynamically allocated to the different links using it.

# Transit 1 & 2 P2P Links (let's assume 100.71.x.x for T1 and 100.72.x.x for T2)
t1_p2p:
  ipv4: 100.71.0.0/24
  prefix: 30
t2_p2p:
  ipv4: 100.72.0.0/24
  prefix: 30
# Internet Exchange LAN
ixp_lan:
  ipv4: 100.70.70.0/24
  prefix: 24
# WINstagram pool (let's assume WINstagram will have reserved 100.80.44.0/24)
wins_lan:
  ipv4: 100.80.44.0/24
  prefix: 24
# Newspaper-X pool (let's assume Newspaper-X will have reserved 100.90.55.0/24)
nx_lan:
  ipv4: 100.90.55.0/24
  prefix: 24
# ACME pools (from 100.100.0.0/20 - 100.100.0.0-100.100.15.255)
# loopbacks (need to override main loopback pool) - let's use the first /24 for loopbacks
loopback:
  ipv4: 100.100.0.0/24
  prefix: 32
## ACME p2p (internal)
acme_p2p:
  ipv4: 100.100.1.0/24
  prefix: 30
## ACME p2p (towards business customers)
acme_p2p_cust:

  prefix: 30
## BRAS Dynamic Pool for residential customers
bras_lan:
